1. Show the distribution of the `price` variable in a plot.

1. How many diamonts are there per `cut`?

1. Show the relation between the `carat` and `price` only for the `fair` diamonds.

1. Now show the relationship between the `carat` and `price` for all the different type of cuts in one graph.

1. For every type of diamond calculate the following variables:
  * minimal `price`
  * maximal `price`
  * mean `price`
  * median `price`
  
1. Calculate the average price per `cut` and show the averages in a graph.
